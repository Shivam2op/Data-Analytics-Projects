#HR Analytics
<h3>
Business Problem: The HR manager reported problem that to know about employee's attendance pattern she has to go through all boring Excel sheets. On those she gets minimum insights and spends most of the time there.</h3>
<h3>So we built a interactive PowerBI Dashboard that gets updated time to time.</h3>

<h3>Problem Solved: HR manager got the best interactive dashboard with accessibility from anywhere and also HR can share this dashboard with managers</h3>
